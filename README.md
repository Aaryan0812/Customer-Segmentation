# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Customer Segmentation Analysis** project aims to identify different customer segments using clustering techniques. This helps businesses target the right user base efficiently.

The project applies **K-Means Clustering** to group customers based on relevant features such as age, gender, and purchasing behavior. Additionally, it provides **data visualizations** to analyze the distribution of customer demographics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset (e.g., customer demographics, purchase behavior).
   - Handle missing values and standardize numerical features.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize age and gender distributions.
   - Identify patterns and trends in customer behavior.
   
3. **Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**
   - Select optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method.
   - Train the K-Means model and assign clusters to customers.
   - Visualize clusters to analyze customer segments.
   
4. **Results & Interpretation**
   - Identify key customer segments.
   - Provide insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## 📊 Visualization & Insights
- **Age & Gender Distribution**: Visualized using bar plots and histograms.
- **Customer Clusters**: Scatter plots and cluster analysis.
- **Elbow Method**: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Experiment with different clustering techniques (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).
- Integrate customer transaction history for deeper insights.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time analysis.
